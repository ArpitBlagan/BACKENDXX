This app is  more focused on sso using passport js (google oth20 and github oth)
where we get email and name of user through google or github and store the user data in mongodb 
and on check route we simple check that user is authenticated or not if not redirect to login page else stay on the main page
I try to keep it simple ya 
Thank you!
